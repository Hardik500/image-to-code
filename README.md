# Image to Code

This was more like a fun project where I would use an image to generate code. The code generated is not perfect and may not work as expected. This is still in development and I will be updating it as I get more ideas.

Motivation: I was simply curious to see how Claude 3.5 Sonnet would generate a working code, and wanted to see if I could do the same. Also, just for fun, 90% of the code is generated by Claude only, I just mentioned the idea and the rest was done by Claude. I wanted to see the limitations of the model and how it would generate the code.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Hardik500/image-to-code.git`
2. Install the required libraries `pnpm`
3. Run the code `pnpm run dev`
